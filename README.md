This is an implementation of the "Mandelbrot Set" in Rust using he Image crate.

The code is not only designed to plot the mandelbrot set but, you can also:
       ---Create an animation zooming into a particular point in the complex plane.
       ---Change your whole coloring scheme.
       ---Can change the function,to get a different fractal pattern.




Example Image:(This is rendered completely by the above code.)

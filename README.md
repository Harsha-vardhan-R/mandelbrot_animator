This is an implementation of the "Mandelbrot Set" in Rust using the Image crate.

The code is not only designed to plot the mandelbrot set but, you can also:
       ---Create an animation zooming into a particular point in the complex plane.
       ---Change your whole coloring scheme.
       ---Can change the function,to get a different fractal pattern.




Example Image(10000 * 10000):(This is rendered completely by the above code.)

None of the code still makes use of concurrency,will be included in future versions.
